Once this limit is reached, it is increased by 1.1% annually, the rate of human population growth.\r\n\r\n####Security:\r\nMined blocks mature after 30 confirms: Argentum is a fast currency but it does not compromise the safety of the blockchain in the process.\r\n\r\n#####Current goals:\r\n\r\n#####Short term:\r\n\r\n-More pools, lots of pools. Hashrate is good for now, but we need wider distribution.\r\n\r\n- Bitsquare.io\r\n\r\n- Coinomi mobile wallet\r\n\r\n#####Mid to long term:\r\n\r\n- Poloniex\r\n\r\n- Shapeshift.io\r\n\r\n- Bittrex\r\n\r\n#####Long term:\r\n\r\n- Payment processor/the ability to exchange goods and services for Argentum.\r\n\r\n\r\n#####Wallets:\r\nARG Wallets v2.3.\r\nWindows QT Wallet: https://github.com/Cryptcollector/ARG-DEV/releases/tag/2.3\r\nMac QT Wallet: Coming Soon\r\nWallet Source: https://github.com/Cryptcollector/ARG-DEV\r\nBootstrap FIle: http://argcurrency.org/download/bootstrap.zip\r\n\r\n#####Nodes:\r\nThese are the current active v2.x nodes as of 9th of July 2016.\r\n    addnode=52.58.154.192  \r\n    addnode=82.176.15.155  \r\n    addnode=157.161.128.63  \r\n    addnode=52.50.240.238  \r\n    addnode=82.29.4.122  \r\n    addnode=149.210.234.234  \r\n    addnode=92.3.38.193  \r\n    addnode=92.3.46.94  \r\n    addnode=82.29.4.122  \r\n    addnode=92.3.37.23  \r\n    addnode=54.246.128.222  \r\n    addnode=162.255.117.105  \r\n    addnode=108.61.10.90  \r\n    addnode=87.98.185.244  \r\n    addnode=52.50.240.238  \r\n    addnode=144.76.71.141  \r\n    addnode=98.115.147.74  \r\n    addnode=96.236.219.30  \r\n    addnode=82.29.4.122  \r\n    addnode=52.58.50.77  \r\n    addnode=138.201.65.88  \r\n\r\n#####Pools:\r\nTransacx: http://arg.transacx.io/ - 2% fee paid directly to the Argentum Donation Address.\r\niSpace: http://scrypt.ispace.co.uk/coindetails/?coin=arg  \r\nBitcoinPOOL.US: http://bitcoinpool.us/  \r\nHash-To-Coins: http://hash-to-coins.com/  \r\nCryptoPools: http://arg.cryptopools.com/  \r\nProhashing: http://www.prohashing.com/    \r\nZPOOL: http://www.zpool.ca/  \r\n\r\n#####BlockExplorer:\r\nCryptoID: https://chainz.cryptoid.info/arg/  \r\nBlockexperts: https://www.blockexperts.com/arg  \r\n\r\n#####Market Info:\r\nCoinMarketCap: http://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/argentum/#charts  \r\nCoinGecko: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/argentum  \r\n\r\n#####Exchanges:\r\nCoinExchange: https://www.coinexchange.io/market/ARG/BTC  \r\nCryptopia: https://www.cryptopia.co.nz/Exchange/?market=ARG_BTC  \r\n\r\n#####Mining:\r\nhttps://www.whattomine.com/coins/158-arg-scrypt\r\n\r\n#####History\r\n\r\n######Argentum was created mid 2013 with the following criteria:\r\n\r\n> Argentum is fast, unique, and secure. We have learned from many of the past crypto-currencies and created one that can rival any. Argentum brings innovation and experimentation by combining interesting aspects of other crypto-currencies > and adding unique features.\r\n\r\n> Argentum is designed to gain value over time and to be a rare commodity that is easily and quickly transferable. The innovation doesn't end there, Argentum is the first crypto-currency to increase transaction processing capabilities over those of bitcoin. With the Bank of Argentum, the ARG/DGC exchange, and other commodity related services on the way, there is a bright future for this coin.\r\n\r\n> Argentum is secure, rare, and unique. The combination of all its characteristics provide a:\r\n1. Longterm stable investment\r\n2. Growth potential based on services\r\n3. Diversification into less risky crypto-currency\r\n4. Secure quasi-instantaneous transaction processing[/quote]\r\n[pre]Taken from the most active ARG BitcoinTalk threads here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=259436.msg2767706#msg2767706 & https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=231524.0.[/pre]\r\n\r\n> The original info is mostly defunct on those threads, hence this new ANN\r\nAlso in the very earliest original launch thread from the original developer AlphaC, there would seem to have been some kind of pre-mine which was used to pay for services rendered to Baritus. So for clarity I will state that there was a historical pre-mine at the beginning of what seems to have been around 200,000 ARG.\r\n\r\n> This pre-mine now will no longer matter as there would seem to be in the regions of over 3.5 million ARG locked in accounts that may be lost to the original holders.\r\n\r\n> We will move on from the past in a New Beginning for Argentum, eventually cutting ties with the original incarnation.\r\n\r\n#####IRC\r\nARGCurrency on FreeNode: https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#ARGCurrency  \r\n\r\n#####Donation Addresses\r\nThe proceeds from these donations will be used to Improve, Promote and encourage ARG services.\r\n\r\nARG Donation Address: ATM1imaiPtFT5K8F2tsPh4RSpw7ADk9a8G\r\nBTC Donation Address: 1LxXw9CRunb5mJfa99aTWQMCqmbroVBUxi\r\n",
